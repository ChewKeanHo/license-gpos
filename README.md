# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's General Public Open Source License

An `"open or die"` general public friendly with copyleft effect open-source
license for [(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product
licensing purposes. This version referenced from
[FSF's GPLv2 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt) and
[FSF's GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) but was written
based on
[Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0)
as its baseline to produce a more reader friendly license file. Among the
notable alteration are:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, etc) without needing to spin multiple licenses; AND
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default; AND
4. No inclusion of software lockdown prohibition (known as "tivoization")
   clauses where the prohibition itself is perceived as an restrictive right to
   use and there are valid use cases such as secure initialization/booting
   using digital signatures; AND
5. No inclusion of patent for GPLv2 compatibility but explictly stated that the
   license overrules any patent, trade secret, or any secrecy's
   terms and conditions when they are contributed into the Product which nullify
   their exclusivities. The Contributor that does this knowingly or unknowingly
   shall bear full responsibility including legal actions from the stakeholders.

> **WARNING**

> **When in doubts OR without absolute certainty, stay clear of this license. **
