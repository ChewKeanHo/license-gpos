# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's General Public Open Source License

A published general public friendly open-source license
**with strong copyleft effect** originally for
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) but is now open to all
product licensing purposes. This license was referenced from
[FSF's GPLv2 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt) and
[FSF's GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) but was adopted
and re-written from the
[Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0)
and [Creative Common Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
as its baseline and applied the following changes:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, audio, etc) without needing to spin multiple outbound licenses; AND
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default; AND
4. No inclusion of software lockdown prohibition (known as "tivoization")
   clauses where the prohibition itself is perceived as an restrictive right
   to use and there are valid use cases such as secure initialization/booting
   using cryptographic digital signature verification; AND
5. Explictly stated that the license overrules any patent, trade secret, or any
   secrecy's terms and conditions if they are contributed into the Product
   which nullify their exclusivities. The Contributor that does this knowingly
   or unknowingly shall bear full responsibility including legal actions from
   the owning stakeholders; AND
6. Expanded grant clauses into Creative Commons' rights categories; AND
7. Added artifical intelligence training dataset clauses; AND
8. Added Sensitive Data warranty and liability coverage; AND
9. Added global vendors (e.g. datacenter) Sensitive Data limitation of
   liability; AND
10. Added force manjure limitation of liability; AND
11. Added global vendors (e.g. datacenter) Sensitive Data limitation of
    liability; AND
12. Added judiciary minimal damage values limitation of liability; AND
13. Added geographical indicator coverage; AND
14. Added protected geographical indicator coverage; AND
15. Added protected designation indicator coverage; AND
16. Added industrial design use coverage; AND
17. Added integrated circuit layout design use coverage; AND
18. Added trade secret use coverage.
